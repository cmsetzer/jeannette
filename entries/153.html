AM
Weather cloudy and stormy. Moderate gale from W.S.W'd. Slight pressure on port-bow at 6. At 9.15 
heavy pressure on port side and ship was listed 3° to port. About 10 the ice slacked up and the ship 
righted. Drifted clear of floe on starboard side and into the lead. Ship water borne. Heeling 2 1/2° to 
starboard. At 12 sounded in 18 1/2 fathoms. Muddy bottom. Drifting to the N'd and E'd. Weather clearing 
and wind decreasing. 

PM
Weather clear and cold. Moderate breeze from W.S.W. Between 5 and 6 ship was subjected to 
tremendous pressures. The first pressure was from right astern and was exerted in a fore and aft 
direction. The others were athwart-ships and were heavy. Ship stood them very well and drifted to the 
E.N.E. (true) as soon as ice slacked. Large sheets of open water in sight. Bright moonlight. Ship swung 
all the way around the compass and about 7 brought up in a large sheet of open water with her bows in 
the young ice on the south side of the open place. Young ice forming over open water. Auroral arch 
between 10 and 12. Brilliant reflections under the moon.

                                        <h5>Published Journals of George W. DeLong</h5>
              <p>See full <a href="http://biodiversitylibrary.org/page/6301273">digitized page</a> provided by the <a href="http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org">Biodiversity Heritage Library</a>. Excerpt:</p>
              <pre class="edited-text">To-day has been one of the most anxious and exciting days we have yet had. At 6.15 a 
slight pressure on the port bow commenced hostilities. At 9.15 a very heavy squeezing on port side 
started our bulwark planking, and pinching down under us heeled the ship 3° to port. At ten a.m. 
the pressure ceased, and we were left floating upright in a small lead of open water, and adrift as 
far as any floe ice was concerned. For a time I was undecided what to do. There was no floe near 
us large enough to anchor to securely, and the chance of another pressure coming while the ship 
was tied up and unable to give to it was too unsatisfactory. If the ship were free when the ice 
moved she would go along with it; if she were tied up she might have to stand the brunt in a very 
unfavorable position. As it was, she lay in a kind of canal a little wider than her own length, and 
ready for action ahead or astern. I concluded to let her remain so, and watch for results. At five 
p.m. I noticed that she commenced floating stern first through the canal. About a mile astern (E.) 
was a large patch of open water, and from ahead (W.) the broken floe pieces were gathering away 
and coming down upon us. At a little bend in the canal her stern took the floe and held fast, while 
her bow payed around as prettily as if we were casting under jibs. No sooner had she got stern to 
the wind than the advancing ice was upon us, and we were pushed, forced, squeezed, driven 
through this mile of a canal amid a grinding and groaning of timbers and a crashing and tumbling of 
ice that was fearful to look at. Still we sailed on, and in a half hour or so were sent out into the 
opening beyond where our speed decreased, and drifting over toward a thin floe we ran our bows 
into the young ice and held fast heading S. Though we moved at no time with greater speed than 
say two knots an hour, our passage through that sluiceway of running ice was enough to make 
one's hair stand on end, and each of us heaved a sigh of relief when it was over. If we had in the 
morning planted an ice-anchor to a small floe, I am convinced this pressure would have torn us 
away from it, and the stream of flowing ice might have jammed us across this canal and given us 
some injury, even if it had not climbed on board.</pre>
