Water expended during the preceding 24 hours: 35 gallons
Water distilled during the preceding 24 hours: 35 gallons
Coal consumed during the preceding 24 hours: 290 lbs
Coal remaining on hand at noon: 48 tons 1308 lbs 

Max. temperature = 10°

The pumping forward is done by hand at the spar deck bilge pump, and such water as filters aft, through 
and under the bulkhead, into the fire room is pumped out by hand at the bilge pump attached to the 
main engine.
The steam cutter's boiler is used for distilling. 
Sounded in 30 fathoms. Muddy bottom. No drift indicated by the lead line. 
The ice about 2 miles S.E. and E. of the ship was found open this morning by hunting parties and large 
masses of ice 7 feet in thickness piled to the heights of 30 and 40 feet in irregular masses on the edges 
of the water lane, indicating severe pressures during the night. The ice between this water lane and the 
ship appeared to be subjected to considerable strain, and at times after noon and until midnight loud 
noises were heard from it around and about the ship. Numerous small cracks were found upon 
examination of the ice after these noises, and the ship experienced slight jars. 
In the afternoon the ice to the S.E. was in motion, straining and grinding and piling up in ridges.
Weather clear, bright and pleasant. Light westerly breezes, rising barometer and low temperature. Bright 
moonlight and starlight before 6am and after 6pm.
At 9pm double auroral arch 60° in alt to the N'd and extending from N.W. to S.E. At midnight faint 
auroral streaks pulsating from W. to E. at an altitude of 45° to the S'd, and a faint arch from W. to E. 45° 
in altitude to the N'd.

                                        <h5>Published Journals of George W. DeLong</h5>
              <p>See full <a href="http://biodiversitylibrary.org/page/6301594">digitized page</a> provided by the <a href="http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org">Biodiversity Heritage Library</a>. Excerpt:</p>
              <pre class="edited-text">The hunting parties, on going out this morning, found an opening in the ice about two miles 
southeast and east from the ship, and extending in alternate open and closed spots for a short distance. 
Where they were closed large ridges of piled-up slabs seven and eight feet thick rose to heights of thirty 
and forty feet. As this occurred since yesterday, the pressure and upheaval must have taken place 
during last night. While going out to the bear-trap yesterday with Mr. Dunbar we noticed several cracks 
along the ice, formed over what had been a lane of water an eighth of a mile northwest of the ship, 
which lane extended in an arc of a circle, or rather curve, around to northeast on one hand, and west on 
the other, at distances varying from one eighth mile to two miles, ending at rough and heavy ice-ridges. 
That ice appeared subjected then to some great strain, and to-day I was concerned to find that the new 
ice around us was receiving strains and pressure. The hunters - Mr. Dunbar especially - described 
the grinding and crashing having recommenced two miles ahead of the ship as they turned to come in; 
and when Nindemann came home, just before supper, he reported that the ice was at work heavily, or, 
as he expressed it, "the whole ocean was alive." 
During the evening various snaps and cracks were heard around the ship, and occasionally we had a 
light jar. Going out repeatedly for examination, we at last found crevices and cracks meandering along 
ahead of the ship under the stern athwart ships, and here and there in other places.</pre>
