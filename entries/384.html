Using melted ice
Coal consumed during the preceding 24 hours: 110 lbs
Coal remaining on hand at noon: 55 tons 2158 lbs 

The pumping is done as required by hand at the quarter deck bilge pump.
Sounded in 23 fathoms. Muddy bottom. A very slight drift to N.E. being indicated by the lead line. 
Lowered and hauled the dredge.
The ice under and astern of the ship was measured to day with the following result:
Thickness of ice under the stern = 5 feet 4 inches below the surface of the water
Thickness of ice 50 feet astern = 4 feet 3 inches below the surface of the water
Thickness of ice 100 feet astern = 5 feet 0 inches below the surface of the water
Thickness of ice 150 feet astern = 5 feet 0 inches below the surface of the water
Thickness of ice 250 yards on starboard quarter = 5 feet 1 inch below the surface of the water
In each case the surface of the ice cut through was 4 inches above the water. The formation has 
occurred since November 30th, 1879. As well as can be determined the ship is lifted forward by a second 
large floe piece which was pushed against and under the surrounding ice on the 19th January and this 
piece extends as far aft as the main mast nearly. She is heeled to the starboard 5°. All of her port side is 
uncovered above a horizontal line connecting the height of 7 feet on her stem with the height of 12 feet 
on her rudder post - as the ice has melted more rapidly and evenly on the port side than on the 
starboard side.
Weather clear, bright, warm and pleasant until 6pm when a dense fog arose and with one hour 
exception continued until midnight. The wind freshened correspondingly to a rise in the barometer.

Water temperatures and specific gravities - insufficient water obtained in cup. 
Surface temperature = 34°

Moon 10° S.

              <pre class="edited-text">Observations to-day show a drift since yesterday of three and seven tenths miles to N. 13° W. 
We seem to be coming up slowly, ice and all, as indicated by the gradual falling of the water-level on our 
hull. Heeling 5° to starboard still, and that is also slightly increasing. Of course I cannot say when this 
will stop. In order to get an idea of the correct thickness of the ice in our neighborhood (in case 
subsequent emergency should make it advisable to dig or saw out a dock, if possible, and make an 
effort to drag the ship into it), I directed Chipp to make borings, and he reports, as far as can be made 
out, the situation as follows: - 
The ship is held firmly by a cradle of ice which, from the mainmast aft, averages five feet in thickness. 
(Under the stem it is five feet four inches thick below the surface of the water.) From ahead to the 
mainmast, about, there is a second floe piece which shoved under the first floe on January 19th.
Thickness of ice below the surface of the water: - 

Under the stem
5 ft. 4 in. 
50 ft. astern
4 ft. 3 in. 
100 ft. astern
4 ft. 3 in. 
150 ft. astern
5 ft. 0 in. 
250 yds. starboard quarter
5 ft. 0 in. 

The ice as a general thing has its surface about four inches above the level of the water. This is what is 
left of the direct freezing since November 30, 1879, of course thawing having taken place on the surface 
by reason of the sun's rays, and underneath by action of the warmth of the water, say 34°.
In company with Melville and Dunbar I walked one of Mr. Dunbar's mile estimates (about two and a half 
miles in fact) to the S.E., where there has been an opening affording seal shooting. In a straight line, as 
a bird would fly, it is about one and a quarter miles distant, the increased amount being caused by 
necessary detours, to go around small ponds which one cannot jump over, and which are in places over 
one's boot-tops in depth. These are, of course, formed from surface thawing. Arrived at the "open water" 
it proved to be nearly closed, a width of six feet only allowing a look down in the depths below. The ice 
seemed to be about four feet in thickness, but looking only was very deceptive. In this precious lane 
there floated a broken portion of the floe, and anxious to realize the sensation of being under way again 
I embarked on it and pushed myself across. Near the old opening there was considerable dirty ice, with 
shells and small pebbles, showing that this ice had been on the bottom, or had rubbed along the land, or 
(query?) was it refuse matter left on it by a walrus? Near by we found a log of birch (?), heavy from 
water soaking, but sound and fresh at the fractured end. Not being able to bring it in we stuck it up in a 
hummock, that some men might let their dogs drag it in tomorrow.</pre>
