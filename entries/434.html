Using melted ice
Coal consumed during the preceding 24 hours: 110 lbs
Coal remaining on hand at noon: 53 tons 848 lbs 

Max. temperature = 36.5°
Min. temperature = 24°

The pumping is done as required by hand at the quarter deck bilge pump. 
Sounded in 39 fathoms. Muddy bottom. A drift to N.E. x N. being indicated by the lead line. Lowered and 
hauled the dredge.
At 9.25am the ship suddenly righted to an even keel and moved astern about two feet, settling until the 
water level was 8 feet 4 inches at the stem and at 13 feet 5 3/4 inches at the rudder-post. The stem being 
16 inches clear of the groove in the floe against which it had been resting, it was supposed that the ship 
was afloat fore and aft; and an ice claw was carried out astern to the ice, and by an attached hawser it 
was attempted to haul the ship astern clear of the large masses of ice surrounding her bows. After 
parting one hawser and only turning the ship one point in azimuth without moving her otherwise, it was 
found that she was still held by the ice under her keel forward, a measuring rod striking hard ice at a 
depth of 7 feet 4 inches below the water level. A second and larger hawser was then got out and hove 
on with the capstan without effect. An ice saw was then employed to saw through a large piece of ice 
against the starboard bow, (and presumably extending below and under the keel) of a thickness of 11 
feet.
After sawing through 5 or 6 feet, the leak (which had been carefully watched from the first movement of 
the ship) was found to increase and all sawing and attempts to drag the ship astern were at once 
discontinued. The gate in the extra bulkhead in the fore peak had been closed promptly at 9.35am and 
the increase of water made its way aft among the frames between ceiling and planking and under 
flooring of the fore peak. 
The leak now requires 3200 strokes of the hand bilge pump per 24 hours against 1295 strokes on the 
11th August. At 8pm the ship was on nearly an even keel with the water level at 8 feet 10 3/4 inches on 
the stem and 13 feet 4 1/2 inches on the rudder post.
In the afternoon the carpenters were engaged at work on the deck house and in repairing sledges.
Weather bright and pleasant during the forenoon but foggy during the afternoon. Light easterly and S.E. 
airs with steady barometer.

Water temperatures and specific gravities
Surface temperature = 35° - Specific gravity = 1.001 at 44°
2 fathoms = 31° - Specific gravity = 1.0238 at 44°
38 fathoms = 31° x - Specific gravity = 1.0248 at 44° x Miller-Casella No 24403

                                        <h5>Published Journals of George W. DeLong</h5>
              <p>See full <a href="http://biodiversitylibrary.org/page/6301563">digitized page</a> provided by the <a href="http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org">Biodiversity Heritage Library</a>. Excerpt:</p>
              <pre class="edited-text">At last we are on an even keel! This morning at 9.35 the ship suddenly righted, and moved 
astern about two feet. It was done very quietly and without shock, except to a dog who was on the gang-
plank, and was suddenly tumbled, to his surprise, on to the ice below. Thin ice had formed around our 
free part to the thickness of nearly an inch, and the cracking and breaking of this film (?) was the only 
accompaniment to our movement. One or two large chunks of ice rose to the surface on the port side, 
and then all was still. 
By previous orders, at the first movement Sweetman ran down in the fore peak and closed the opening 
in the extra bulkhead built last January. We feared that on taking the water again our leak might largely 
increase, but we found for the time no difference. The water-level on the ship was at the height of eight 
feet four inches on the stem, and thirteen feet five and three fourths inches on the rudder-post. Believing 
that the ship was fairly afloat (her stem being sixteen inches from the groove in which it had been 
resting), we carried an ice-claw to the floe astern, placing it on our port quarter, and, attaching a hawser, 
tried heaving with the capstan. To our surprise, beyond swinging her bow a little to starboard, perhaps a 
point, the ship was immovable. Thinking the ice on either bow was holding her, we took the ice-claw in a 
line right astern, and hove again until we parted the hawser. Then we went to examining the ice around 
her bows. The groove in which her stem had rested was in plain sight, and a crack in that floe extended 
right ahead. Right against the bows on either side there was water, but on reaching down a measuring 
rod under the starboard cat-head Chipp found it strike on ice at a depth of seven feet four inches. 
Evidently, then, her keel and forefoot were yet held in a cradle. Desiring to get a little away from the 
heavy floe which had damaged us last winter, a larger hawser was got out right astern and hove on, but 
without effect. The ice-saw, worked by a rope from the fore yard, was then brought into play, and put 
down a hole which we found in the cradle-piece, which, with its other part eleven feet in thickness, we 
commenced to saw through six feet, dinner time came and we stopped. A careful watch had been kept 
of the leak, and it was now found that more water was coming in than formerly. I was anxious naturally 
to get the ship afloat properly, but of course I did not want to do so at the cost of materially increasing 
the leak while there was no chance to navigate her. Upon reflection, I concluded to leave well enough 
(or bad enough) alone, and accordingly all sawing and hauling was suspended.</pre>
