Water expended during the preceding 24 hours: 35 gallons
Water distilled during the preceding 24 hours: 35 gallons
Coal consumed during the preceding 24 hours: 255 lbs
Coal remaining on hand at noon: 16 tons 1743 lbs 

Max. temperature = 27°
Min. temperature = 21°

The pumping forward is done by hand at the spar deck bilge pump, and such water as filters aft through 
and under and bulkhead into the fire room is pumped out by hand at the bilge pump attached to the 
main engine.
The steam cutter's boiler is used for distilling.
The engineer's force are occupied in putting the wind mill pumping gear into working order.
Weather generally dull and gloomy, the sun occasionally however breaking through the clouds. Light 
variable airs and calms. Rising barometer and uniform temperature.
John Lauterbach (coal heaver) sustained a severe sprain in the back by reason of an accident in the 
transporting of a skin boat over the ice. He was one of a party of men engaged in this work, and while 
carrying the boat on their shoulders, it slipped and brought too much weight on this single man.
At 8am the ice was found to have opened in numerous long lanes, some connected and some single 
extending generally in the N.N.W. and S.S.E. direction. By making occasional portages boats were able 
to go several miles from the vessel, but for the ship herself there were no ice openings of sufficient 
magnitude.
Sounded in 40 1/2 fathoms. Muddy bottom. A slight drift to W.N.W. being indicated by the lead line.
The strong appearance of land mentioned on the 18th inst. proves to day to have been land in fact, and 
for reasons similar to those herein set forth (in the remarks of the 16th inst) it may be recorded as 
another discovery. This second land is an island, of which the position and present distance are yet to 
be ascertained. The following bearings were taken.
Ship's head = S. 14° W. true
Eastern end of island first seen on 16th inst. = S. 17° W. true
Nearest end (southern?) of island seen to day = S. 69° 30' W. true
The following sextant angles were taken from the crow's nest.
Island first seen subtends an angle of 2° 42' - island seen to day subtends an angle of 3° 35'
Island first seen has an altitude of 0° 16' - island seen to day has an altitude of 0° 10'
Interval between two islands = 49° 55'

                                        <h5>Published Journals of George W. DeLong</h5>
              <p>See full <a href="http://biodiversitylibrary.org/page/6301672">digitized page</a> provided by the <a href="http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org">Biodiversity Heritage Library</a>. Excerpt:</p>
              <pre class="edited-text">The first thing I heard upon arising this morning was that more land was in sight, and the next 
thing was that the ice was very slack, with many large lanes of water. The strong appearance of land on 
the 20th, towards midnight, proves to have been land in reality, - another island being added to our 
discoveries, somewhat longer (if not less distant) than our first named. Upon going up to the crow's nest 
I had a good view of both islands and of more water than we have seen since September, 1879. In 
consequence of the subsidence of the wind, the ice has become very slack, and numerous long 
openings or lanes have occurred, varying in width from twenty to one hundred feet, and in length from 
one eighth mile to three miles. Unfortunately for purposes of navigation they are not connected, and 
though having a general northwest and southeast direction, do not lead to anything. Just at this moment 
I would be contented if by any means I could get the ship into one of these islands for a temporary 
breathing spell, and a chance to get some game for our supplies; but, unfortunately, I cannot saw 
through thirty miles of ice or blast that amount out of my way. The lanes of water are very tantalizing, for 
they indicate what might be done if there were more of them. They seem to be in our neighborhood only, 
or within a radius of five miles, while the islands are thirty, and say forty miles off, - and from that five 
miles radius to the islands the ice is as close and compact as ever.</pre>
