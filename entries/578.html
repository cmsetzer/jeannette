Water expended during the preceding 24 hours: 35 gallons
Water distilled during the preceding 24 hours: 35 gallons
Coal consumed during the preceding 24 hours: 290 lbs
Coal remaining on hand at noon: 34 tons 1038 lbs 

Max. temperature = -44°
Min. temperature = -47°

The pumping forward is done by hand at the spar deck bilge pump, and such water as filters aft through 
and under the bulkhead into the fire room is pumped out by hand at the bilge pump attached to the main 
engine.
The steam cutter's boiler is used for distilling.
Sounded in 30 fathoms. Muddy bottom. No drift being indicated by the lead line.
At 11am the ship was inspected by the Commanding Officer, and at 1.30pm divine service was 
performed in the cabin.
Weather clear, bright and pleasant, the sky being cloudless much of the time. Light southerly airs 
veering to light S.W. breeze with rapidly rising and extraordinarily high barometer, and uniformly very 
low temperature. At noon there was a bright red glow on southern horizon, and at 3pm the S.W. (true) 
horizon had a warm red glow. Remarkably clear atmosphere in all directions, though the horizon was 
much raised by refraction.
At 3am an auroral arch from S.E. to S.W. 10° in altitude, and also broken curtain and irregular streaks 
and patches from W.N.W. around by north to S.E. 10° to 15° in altitude, at 6am arch from S.E. to S.W. 
10° in altitude, with streaks and patches in E. and W. direction from arch to zenith. 
About 9pm there was a remarkable auroral display which is described by Lieut. Chipp as follows: "At 
about 8.50pm there were 3 auroral curtains extending in arches from a mass of green and yellow light 
near the N.W. horizon to near the east horizon. The upper arch was about 60° and the others about 45° 
and 30° respectively. The highest arch was the most brilliant. The general color was a bright yellow. 
Suddenly a brown-red color flashed across from N.W. to E., and the curtains were violently agitated. 
Luminous rays formed, darting across the curtains with variable lengths. Meanwhile the curtains 
undulated violently with short quick waves from N.W. to E., and at the same time would change their 
altitudes up and down about 5°, keeping about the same space apart. The darting of rays and rapid 
undulations, gave the arches the appearance of torrents of light rushing from N.W. to E. The lower parts 
of the curtains were cherry-red, next green, while the greater part was of a bright yellow. The cherry-red 
rays from the bases of the curtains flashing in with rays of green and yellow caused many colors to be 
seen, so that the lower halves of the curtains looked not unlike irregular rainbows violently agitated. 
During this display the north end of the galvanometer needles connected in the cabin was deflected 20° 
E. (not an unusual amount) having been 10° east at 8pm and again at 9.10pm when the great brilliancy 
had ceased." 
Another description, by Lieut. DeLong is as follows: "At 9pm from the N.W. horizon there projected 
upward a curving column of brilliant green and reddish-pink light in violent movement (resembling the 
movement but far exceeding the brightness of a flame shooting from a Castan signal light) which, while 
undergoing twistings and undulations every half second spread out at an altitude of 10° above the 
horizon into 3 magnificent curtain arches spanning the sky at altitudes of 35° 40° and 45° respectively 
and extending to the eastern horizon. These arches were in a state of violent agitation, flashing, 
trembling and pulsating every half second while receiving and passing along repeated changes from the 
supplying column. The upper portion of each curtain was of the usual greenish-white color, the middle 
portion was of a vivid pale green; and the under portion consisted of an exceedingly delicate pink fringe 
which trembled and quivered without rest. Numerous bands above and beneath the arch showed the 
pulsations of colored lights also but to no very marked extent. In about 15 minutes the supply seemed to 
diminish in the column and the lights to grow faint. The arches and bands then rose, massing at the 
zenith in an arch 10° in width while some of the pulsations were repeated, but backward, as if returning 
to their source, and the broad arch separated into several narrower ones, loops, and coronas, leaving 
the sky in a state of general illumination."
