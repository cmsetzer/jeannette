              This entry contains remarks related to the following subject: <span class="badge badge-entity sea-ice">Sea Ice</span>            </div>
          </div>
          <pre class="edited-text">Water expended during the preceding 24 hours: 35 gallons
Water distilled during the preceding 24 hours: 35 gallons
Coal consumed during the preceding 24 hours: 1 ton 394 lbs
Coal remaining on hand at noon: 96 tons 508 lbs 

As the limber holes under the coal bunkers remained frozen or otherwise choked to such an extend as 
to prevent the ready flow of water aft to the steam pump, it was decided at the beginning of these twenty 
four hours to remove an auxiliary steam pump from the engine room to the old galley room, over the 
chain lockers, and by running a line of piping from the main boiler to it, and attaching a suction pipe 
leading into the flour room, pump out sufficient water to enable us to build a bulkhead across the fore 
peak which would control the flow of water to such an extent as to permit the occasional using of the 
bilge pump keeping the ship free. Work was immediately commenced on this auxiliary pump, and it was 
placed in the old galley room, and necessary repairs were made to it. After it was in place an attempt 
was made to run it by the Baxter boiler, but it was found that the pump was too large for the capacity of 
the boiler, exhausting it almost immediately, and the plan was abandoned. Engineer's force was then 
employed to fit and run the line of steam piping to get steam from the main boiler through the steam 
whistle pipe. The work is not complete at midnight. While this work was going on the remainder of the 
crew were kept at work by watches in pumping the water out by the forward bilge pump on deck, being 
able to keep the water under control, and even occasionally getting the water down to 12 inches. Such 
water as flowed aft to the engine room was at once pumped out by the steam pump there, and towards 
the close of the day the flow was freer, enabling us to use the steam pump in engine room for 15 
minutes in every half hour. All the sea cocks being frozen fast in their seats the boiler is blown as 
occasion requires into the bilge, and is fed from the bilge. 
Broke out the starboard chain locker, and moved a lot of provisions aft on quarter deck. Discontinued 
using Baxter boiler to distil water, being able to distil below in the engine room, and requiring all the pipe 
connections of the Baxter boiler to lead steam from steam whistle pipe to auxiliary pump forward. 
Considerable ice movement and pressure during the day. The ship is heeled 3° to starboard and the floe 
in which she is embedded has swung one and a quarter points in azimuth. Light breezes from between 
S. & W. all day with slowly falling barometer and slightly rising temperature. The movement of the ice 
seems to be to the E'd. Then are numerous ridges in sight where the floes have been broken and piled 
up upon coming in contact. The floe around the ship remains the same as yesterday but when pressed 
yields in heavy surges which causes the ship to crack and scrape. A careful examination shows no 
signs of anything having given away below, and every reason for the opinion of yesterday that the fore 
foot has been sprung off starting the garboard strakes.

              <pre class="edited-text">Considerable ice movement and pressure during the day. The ship has increased her heel 
to three degrees to starboard, and floe and ship have swung to south by west one and one fourth 
points. Light breezes between S. and W. all day, and temperature struggling up from minus 44° to 
minus 37°. The movement of the ice seems to be to the eastward. There are numerous ridges in 
sight where the floes have been broken and piled up upon coming in contact. The floe around the 
ship remains as yesterday, but when pressed yields in heavy surges which cause the ship to snap 
and crack.</pre>
