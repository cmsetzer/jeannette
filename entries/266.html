Sounded at noon in 30 fathoms, muddy bottom, drift to the westward being indicated by the lead line. 
Dawn light showing faint ruddy tint at 2am. Bright dawn at 3. 
Ice 4 1/2 inches in thickness formed over sounding hole since noon yesterday.
Weather clear, light and pleasant with very light northerly and westerly winds and very slowly falling 
barometer and increasing temperature. Crew engaged in digging away the ice under the bows. The bear

same also in the east and west.

                                        <h5>Published Journals of George W. DeLong</h5>
              <p>See full <a href="http://biodiversitylibrary.org/page/6301383">digitized page</a> provided by the <a href="http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org">Biodiversity Heritage Library</a>. Excerpt:</p>
              <pre class="edited-text">The crew were engaged again to-day in digging away the ice under the bows. We have now got 
down to the eight foot mark, and have such a thin layer of ice between the hole and the water that 
digging has to cease. If we let the water through it will flow up and freeze, and we shall have a mess 
again up to the original level; but if we let the freezing go on downward for some time we may be able to 
dig deeper. In connection with this freezing downward, it is a subject of inquiry as to what depth this 
freezing can take place. We have not seen any single floe of greater thickness than seven feet, ten 
inches, and I suppose that eight feet may be assumed as the maximum thickness of floe ice by direct 
freezing, as stated by Dr. Kane. Dr. Walker says that the floe ice in which the Fox drifted had only five 
feet of thickness. The floe which we saw and measured as having seven feet ten inches thickness was a 
portion of floe hove up in the great pressures in November; but whether it was direct freezing, or a 
series of two or more floes overlying each other, I cannot say. When we floated out to open water on 
November 28th, I commenced the regular measurement of the ice as it froze by measuring in the fire-
hole. The last measurement made was on the 17th January, when the direct freezing was forty-six 
inches since November 28th. This was a piece of ice formed around us, and which had been up-ended 
in pressure. Measurements in the fire-hole had become unsatisfactory, because of the tendency of the 
ice to assume the sides of an inverted funnel, and lead to grave doubts as to the position of our 
measuring-rod. On the 4th March a crack in the floe enabled us to get a thickness of four feet, direct 
freezing of thirty days, the freezing having commenced when we had a temperature of minus 36.5°, and 
continued while the highest temperature recorded was minus 22°, and the lowest minus 53°. So much of 
the floe in which the ship is held is underrun by other floes, that finding a clear place to bore for a single 
thickness is like looking for a needle in a hay-stack. I have concluded to wait until a fresh break will 
enable us to get a correct vertical measurement of the thickness of ice frozen since November 28th. As 
ice is a non-conductor of heat, it follows that there must be some thickness at which the ice prevents the 
heat escaping from the water under it, and places a limit to the depth of freezing. At the time the ice was 
four feet thick the surface floated only four inches above the level of the water.</pre>
